## Phase 4: Validation and Documentation

### 4.1. Full System Validation
- [ ] Train small models with NSA on standard benchmarks
- [ ] Compare perplexity and loss curves against baseline
- [ ] Validate memory usage improvements
- [ ] Test on long sequence tasks

### 4.2. Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Document integration process
- [ ] Create usage examples

## Testing Strategy

Each phase will include comprehensive testing with:

1. **Unit tests** for individual components
2. **Integration tests** for component interactions
3. **System tests** for full model behavior
4. **Performance benchmarks** to validate efficiency claims

The testing framework will:
- Compare output tensors with reference implementations
- Verify gradients through finite difference approximation
- Ensure numerical stability across precision types
- Validate memory usage improvements
- Measure throughput in tokens/second
